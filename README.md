# WCSPH
WCSPH, or Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, is a great method for the modelling of fluid flows - particularly liquid motion. Typical applications are scenarios such as tank sloshing, wave breaking and many others. The aim for this specific repository is to apply this to situations with a high Weber number, like jets in a crossflow or coflow, typically found in fuel injection or jettison. 
The specific scenario of the PhD associated with this repository is aircraft fuel jettison. For the initial breakup of the fuel where it's acting very much like a liquid, the current plan is to use SPH for the model.
